                        I love playing video games. The first game console I had was the Super Nintendo! Since then my collection of game consoles have grown as well as my video games.
                        I range from Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox and PC. My favorite genre of video games would have to be rpgs. 
                        I'm not a big fan of turn by turn style ones even though I do enjoy playing Pokemon.

                            Cooking and baking are one of my favorite things to do. It's originally what I went to school for. 
                            I have been told many times that I should make a food blog since I'm always posting pictures on facebook and snapchat.
                            I find that cooking and baking is a good way to let off some built up stress. Especially when it comes kneading dough, or tenderizing meat.

                        I love collecting special editions of video games. Sometimes it's not intentional, and I think that is how this little hobby of mine started. 
                        I walked into Gamestop and they had the collectors edition of Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild on the back table. It wasn't reserved si I bought it.
                        I got collectors editions that range from having statues, whiskey glasses, and music boxes!

                        I've been working at Chipotle for the past 5 years. The work I do ranges from cooking, serving customers, office work, cleaning and a few other things.
                        They keep asking me if I would like to move up with Chipotle and I have decided to do that by furthering my education.
                        Chipotle has been kind enough to pay for my education with the option of debt free degrees by going to an online college with select degrees.
                        My goal with this degree is to get into the Chipotle IT department.

                        I did 2 years of culinary arts in high school by going to BOCES. After that I took a year off so I could work and pay for college out of pocket because I refused to take out loans.
                        I did 5 semesters at Suffolk Community College for culinary arts, but I never finished. I've learned how to make so many different things because of my Professors. 
                        I also know a bunch of french terms for culinary that confuses everyone outside a professional kitchen. I've been having a blast learning software development at Bellevue University.
                        It's a nice change of pace compared to the hustle and bustle of the kitchen.

                        One of the things that started for me when I was younger that I never pursued. 
                        I always had an Interest in Programming when I was younger but there were no courses or after school activities for it back then, at least at my school.
                        I like watching things come to life with computers and one day hope to learn animatronics.
